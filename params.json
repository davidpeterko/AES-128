{"name":"Ko Encryption","tagline":"","body":"### Ko Encryption\r\n\r\n##Who was it for?\r\n\r\nThis was a project for the course Intro to Computer Security \r\n\r\n## What was it?\r\n\r\nIt is an encryption algorithm based on AES 256, but instead is just a little inferior and is the AES 128 version, but has the same principles of diffusion and confusion. \r\n\r\n## When was it?\r\n\r\nThis was done in the month of June 2015.\r\n\r\n##Where was this?\r\n\r\nThis was done at the University of Texas computer lab.\r\n\r\n##Why was it done?\r\n\r\nTest my Java programming skills and knowledge of cryptography to try and understand the ins and outs of the AES.\r\n\r\n## How was it done?\r\n\r\nIt was done in Java using the structure of how AES 256 was implemented: using the functions subBytes, shiftRows, mixColumns, and addRoundkey. I read alot on Rijndael to figure out the subtle differences between AES 128, 192, and 256. This required a good understand of key expansion, to which I used alot of internet references as a supplement. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
