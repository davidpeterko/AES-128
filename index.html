<h2>
<a id="who-was-it-for" class="anchor" href="#who-was-it-for" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who was it for?</h2>

<p>This was a project for myself for being able to encrypt sensitive data. </p>

<h2>
<a id="what-was-it" class="anchor" href="#what-was-it" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What was it?</h2>

<p>It is an encryption algorithm based on AES 256. It has the underlying components of AES; the diffusion and confusion, but with another twist to try and make AES even stronger than it already is.</p>

<h2>
<a id="when-was-it" class="anchor" href="#when-was-it" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>When was it?</h2>

<p>I recently started working on this project, within the last 2 months.</p>

<h2>
<a id="where-was-this" class="anchor" href="#where-was-this" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Where was this?</h2>

<p>I have been working on this back and forth between my home and the computer lab on the campus of the University of Texas.</p>

<h1>
<a id="why-was-it-done" class="anchor" href="#why-was-it-done" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why was it done?</h1>

<p>Test my Java programming skills and knowledge of cryptography to try and create a better encryption scheme.</p>

<h2>
<a id="how-was-it-done" class="anchor" href="#how-was-it-done" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How was it done?</h2>

<p>By writing an AES 256 implementation by myself in Java, I slowly picked apart different parts of the AES that I wanted to modify for myself. I do not want to give away the specifics because that would defeat the purpose of having an encryption if they would reverse engineer the decryption. But heres a hint: it modifies the 4 components of AES (addRoundKeys, mixColumns, etc) and it may or may not try and apply transposition and substitution at unspecified places! Good luck!</p>
